- Led a team of 3 teammates in building a cloud-based model operating GCP platform and Apache Spark engines to optimize performance and run a prediction model on high-volume AMEX dataset
- Preprocessed 16gb AMEX data, creating 305 features to predict customer default behavior, achieving a high level of accuracy
- Incorporated and experimented with various ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Trees to evaluate performance using the F1 score evaluation metric
- Exhibited exceptional performance of model by attaining an F1 score of 89% using Logistic Regression, and enhanced interpretability of model by utilizing game theory techniques such as Shapley and utilizing Streamlit as front-end interface
