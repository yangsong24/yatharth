- Worked upon " Deep learning based channel estimation for Massive MIMO systems."
- Studied in-depth about various techniques for efficient channel estimation.
- Built a new model using deep learning based denoising for channel estimation of OFDM Massive MIMO communication systems achieving superior performance.
- Check out my thoughts about research in [IITR](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yatharth-bansal-b919671b4_research-iitroorkee-wirelesscommunications-activity-6847462077444030464-GJmJ).
