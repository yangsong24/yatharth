- Researched on new emerging technology of Cell-free Massive MIMO systems for beyond 5g systems
- Implemented LS and MMSE channel estimation in MATLAB for Cell-free Massive MIMO systems
- Investigated problem of channel estimation leveraging deep learning techniques, focusing on operating 2 untrained models including Deep Decoder and Deep Image Prior for denoising received signal
- Authored and presented a research manuscript titled *"An Untrained DNN Denoiser for Uplink Channel Estimation in Multicell Massive MIMO System"* at [33rd IEEE PIMRC conference](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9978046)
