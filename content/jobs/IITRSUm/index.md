- Implemented LS and MMSE channel estimation schemes in MATLAB for Massive MIMO communication systems
- Proposed and tested a denoising signal approach for dealing with pilot contamination in channel estimates, leveraging 2 untrained deep learning models namely Deep Image Prior (DIP) and Deep Decoder
- Achieved a superior channel estimation performance by at least 10% compared to LS and MMSE schemes, and demonstrated robustness against cases of pilot contamination operating NMSE as performance metric
