I am a final year undergrad student studying [Telecommunications Engineering](http://ei.hust.edu.cn/English/Home.htm) at Huazhong University of Science and Technology [HUST](http://english.hust.edu.cn/).
I am an Indian who went to China to learn and explore. China not only gave me knowledge and skills but also gave me
a new identity as **杨松** yang song (my chinese name).

I am a student with research interests in the field of Wireless Communication Systems and Machine Learning.
